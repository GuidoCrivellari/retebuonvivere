Retebuonvivere: network admin tools

Description
-----------
This is a [drupal feature][2], which will install the tools for the network administrators (role Netowrk Admin) for retebuonvivere website.

At the moment there is only a view to list organizations creted by means of entity reference autocreate. The resulting table is a helper for the administrator who can see which organizations to send an email to.

Future work
-----------
We can extend this feature in order to allow the network administrator to check (using [VBO][3]) rows and select a rule (custom [rules][4]) to send an email to the org.
