Retebuonvivere: relation graph view

Description
-----------
This is a [drupal feature][2], which will create the section named *Vedi la rete*, italian for "See the network", of retebuonvivere website.
This feature is a [drupal view][3] of content of types Organization and Projects, showing a network graph by means of graphapi module as api and d3 module as graphics engine. 
It is a basic first step. What we want to achieve is a mixture of this two network visualization techniques: [linkedin inmaps][4] (with side panes offering nodes and edges information, and different networks-edges coloring) and [mit media lab immersion][5] (with timeline capabilities and egonetwork exploration) and both for community pattern recognition and coloring.
