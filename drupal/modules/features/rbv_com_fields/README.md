rbv_com_fields
==============

Description
-----------
This is a [drupal feature][1], which will install all the common fields for the site **retebuonvivere.org**; common taxonomy vocabularies; and sitewise roles.

For common fields we mean all the fields which can be used by more than one content type, i.e. they are not content specific.
In machine names of common fields we use the prefix *_com*, e.g. in *field_com_logo*.

Sitewise roles (besides standard administrator, anonymous user, authenticated user), we use *organization member* (for all the people who are members of an on_group of type organization) and *network admin* (people who can add new organization group).

We have these vocabularies: Categorie (for main categories), Ruoli(people roles in organizations), Tags (freetagging), Tipi di organizzazione (organization types), Tipi di relazione (relation types).
