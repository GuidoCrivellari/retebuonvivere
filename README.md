===============

Description
-----------
The Drupal make file for retebuonvivere website.

Submodule of
------------
This repository is a submodule of [retebuonvivere][0]

Start
-----
Create a new drupal installation using [drush][3] from retebuonvivere makefile, following [these][2] instructions: 

1. Download all the necessary modules, themes, libraries and patches in their right subdirectories with the following command (`--working-copy` option preserves git directories):

   `drush make --working-copy retebuonvivere.make sitename`

2. Create new db with all permission.

3. Install drupal with standard profile with the following command (from drupal root directory 'sitename'):

   `drush site-install standard --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin --db-url=mysql://dbuser:dbpass@localhost/dbname`

Now you need to enable all the modules by hand because we didn't build the profile module yet (see â†’Documentation below).

Documentation
-------------
All the documentation for development (soft/hard configuration, profile, makefile, distributions, ...) is at rbv_profile [wiki][1].
