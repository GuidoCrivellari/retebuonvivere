# Sketches

You can follow this idea in some mockup images:

* Organization line 

  ![lines.jpg](images/lines.jpg)
  
* Some organizations drawn together with project lines starting from intersections (projects lines are an entanglement of organization threads)

* Project ego-meshwork

* Lines details

* Christian Lovato's projection. 

  Christian suggests that the meshwork display is just onother projection of a 3D graph; while the network display is a top view, the meshwork is a side view. Here is his picture:

* Storyline visualizations
  We have already coded our meshwork visualization, leveraging the force-layout algorithm, and I'm quite content with it. But recently I discovered that so much was already done bu computer scientists. So I would like to build on this work, in the future, and I start here with a new sketch drawn after reading some papers.
